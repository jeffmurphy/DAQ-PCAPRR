This DAQ module implements "round robin" reading from network interfaces. 

Normally you would use the bonding driver to bond network interfaces together,
and then attach Snort to the bonded interface (e.g. bond0). 

Systems equiped with high performance cards made by Endace.com are unable
to do this (the bonding driver and the endace driver won't work with each 
other). 

This DAQ module was created to allow you to merge streams from multiple Endace 
cards together. 


Building the PCAPRR DAQ Module
==============================

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

This will build and install this dynamic DAQ module.

Note that pcap >= 1.0.0 is required.  pcap 1.1.1 is available at the time
of this writing and is recommended.

Using the Module
================

To listen on multiple interfaces (in this example the fourth stream from
each card):

    ./snort --daq-dir=/usr/lib64/daq --daq pcaprr -i dag0:4,dag1:4

You are not limited to two interfaces. 

You should adjust --dag-dir to point to whereever this module gets 
installed (by 'make install') on your system.

Reading from a file is not supported in this module, use the default "pcap" 
module instead.

You can specify the buffer size pcap uses with:

    ./snort --daq-dir=/usr/lib64/daq --daq pcaprr --daq-var buffer_size=<#bytes> -i dev0,dev1,etc

* The pcaprr DAQ does not count filtered packets. *
